**Computational Analysis:**
 
All analyses were performed using R custom scripts. Frequency of mutations in ARID1A and/or PIK3CA were identified by querying the [cBioPortal](http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/) on 2013-11-13 using the R API.  Cerami et al Cancer Discov. 2013 & Gao et al Sci. Signal. 2013. 
We considered to be altered any tumor with a mutation or GISTIC score of +/-2.
